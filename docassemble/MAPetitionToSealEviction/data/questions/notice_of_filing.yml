question: |
  This interview will help you create a Notice of Filing for your Petition to Seal.
subquestion: |
  If you are an evicted tenant, you can use this interview to notify the landlord who evicted you that you have filed a petition to seal the eviction proceedings.
  
  **Before you get started, please gather:**
  
    1. The docket or other case materials (such as a letter from the court) from the eviction action.
    2. Your petition to seal. 
  
  **When you are finished, you will need to:**
  
    1. Print and sign the notice form.
    2. Send the completed notice form to the landlord who evicted you.
    
    **IMPORTANT:** you only need to create a notice if you faced an eviction action for nonpayment of rent or for fault, or if you have satisfied any judgment entered against you in a nonpayment or fault action. 
    If none of these apply to you do not need to create a notice of filing.


  Most people take about 10 minutes to complete this interview.
