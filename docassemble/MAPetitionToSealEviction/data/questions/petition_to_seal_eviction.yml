    Petition to Seal Eviction
  description: |-
    This interview helps someone in Massachusetts file a Petition to Seal a prior eviction from public record.

    Sealing your eviction record means that a landlord cannot see your eviction record when they do a background check,
    and that you can legally answer "no" when asked if you have ever been evicted.

    This means that a landlord cannot use your eviction record against you when you apply for housing.
  can_I_use_this_form: |
    If you are a tenant whose landlord started an eviction case, you may be able to use this petition
    to seal your eviction record.

    To seal your eviction record, you must:

    * Have a judgment in your favor or a dismissal of the case, or
    * Be evicted for a no-fault reason and be past the appeal window, or
    * Be evicted for nonpayment of rent and have paid all amounts due in rent, or
    * Be evicted for nonpayment of rent, be unable to pay the rent due to economic hardship, and have not been evicted for nonpayment of rent in the last 4 years, or
    * Be evicted for a fault reason and have not been evicted for a fault reason in the last 7 years, or
    * Be evicted for a 139 § 19 reason and have not been evicted for a 139 § 19 reason in the last 7 years or convicted of a related crime in the last 7 years.

    The interview will help you understand if you qualify to seal your eviction record. It may be able to help you get some information
    about your case from the court electronically.
  before_you_start: |
    Before you get started, please gather:
    
    1. Your former address and the name of the court your eviction action was heard in
    2. The docket number (also called the "case number") of your eviction action
    3. Any other documents relating to your eviction action
    
    When you are finished, you will need to e-file the petition with the applicable court.
    Depending on the kind of decision you had in your case, you may also need to give a copy of the petition to your former landlord.

  Petition to seal an eviction
subquestion: |
  If you are a tenant whose landlord filed an eviction case against you, 
  you can use this interview to ask a judge or clerk to seal the court information. 
  
  Not all tenants qualify to seal their eviction record. This interview should not be used by commercial tenants seeking to seal an eviction.

  This interview will:

  * Help you understand if you can seal your eviction record using this interview.
  * Fill out a Petition to Seal Eviction Record Pursuant to G.L. c. 239, § 16 to file with the court.

  Before you get started, please gather:
    
  1. The docket number (also called the "case number") of the eviction case you want to seal<br>
  ([find your docket number](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/how-to-search-court-dockets?_gl=1*1t4lg0v*_ga*Mjc1NTYwNDQxLjE3NDE2MjkwMjA.*_)&nbsp;<sup>:up-right-from-square:&nbsp;(opens in new tab)</sup>)
  2. The name of the court that your eviction case was heard in
  3. Any other court documents from your eviction case
 
  Your court documents should have the information you need to fill out a petition. You can also find some of the information on [MassCourts.org](https://masscourts.org)&nbsp;<sup>:up-right-from-square:&nbsp;(opens in new tab)</sup>.

  <b>NOTE:</b> When you are finished, you will need to file this petition with the Court, either by eFile using a valid email address or in person with the Clerk's office.

  Most people take about 10 minutes to complete this interview.

  How do I know what eviction reason to write?
content: |
  Look at the paperwork that you got from your landlord and from the court. Look for the key words:

  * "Nonpayment of rent"
  * "Cause" or "Breach of lease"
  * "No cause", "No fault" or "without the fault of the tenant"
  * "139 § 19" or "nuisance"

  Even if you were evicted for a "fault" reason, your landlord may have also listed a "nonpayment" reason.
  Make sure to check the box for "fault" if the landlord said in the court paperwork that you broke another part of the lease.

  How do I know how the case ended?
content: |
  Look at the final decision from the court or the final document you signed to see how your case ended.

  If you signed an agreement, it might have been an agreement to dismiss the case,
  or an agreement that said one party had a judgment against them.

  Look for key words in the agreement or decision title.

  A **stipulation of dismissal** is a written agreement by the parties asking the court to dismiss the case. 
  The parties may include some other terms in the agreement, but the main purpose of the agreement is to request the 
  case be dismissed. If your agreement was a stipulation of dismissal, then check the box that says, 
  "The eviction case was dismissed by the court or in a written agreement."

  An **agreement for judgment** is a written agreement by the parties asking the court to enter judgment in favor
  of either the landlord or the tenant. The agreement for judgment may include other terms but the main purpose
  is to request that the court enter a judgment.
  
  * If your agreement was an agreement for judgment in your favor,
  then check the box that says, "The eviction case ended with a court ruling in my favor."
  * If the agreement for judgment was in favor of your landlord, then check the box that says, 
  "The eviction case ended with the court ruling against me."

  A **default judgment** enters when the tenant fails to appear in court and the landlord appears. 
  If a default judgment was entered against you, check the box that says, 
  "The eviction case ended with the court ruling against me"
  
  A **dismissal judgment** enters when the landlord fails to appear in court and the tenant appears. 
  If a dismissal judgment was entered against your landlord, check the box that says, 
  "The eviction case was dismissed by the court or in a written agreement."

  How do I find my docket number?
content: |
  If you do not know your docket number (also called the "case number"), search by your name on [MassCourts.org](https://masscourts.org)&nbsp;<sup>:up-right-from-square:&nbsp;(opens in new tab)</sup>.
  You may also see the docket number written on paperwork that you got from the court or from your landlord.

  A docket number almost always:

  * Starts with a 2 or 4 digit year
  * Is followed by a code for the court, like H84 for the Eastern Housing Court or 52 for Cambridge District Court
  * Is followed by a code for the case type, like SP, SU, or CV
  * Ends in a number that is unique to your case, usually with leading zeros to make it 6 digits

  Example: **30H84SP009123**. (This is not a real docket number. Use the number on your paperwork.)

  If you think you know the docket number but you cannot find your case, try making sure that the number follows the
  rules above. For example, remove any punctuation.
