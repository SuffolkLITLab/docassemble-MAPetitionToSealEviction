  Petition to seal an eviction
subquestion: |
  If you are a tenant whose landlord filed an eviction case against you, 
  you can use this interview to ask a judge to seal the court information.

  * Help you understand if you can seal your eviction record using this interview.
  * Fill-out a Petition to Seal Eviction Record Pursuant to G.L. c. 239, § 16 to file with the court.

  Before you get started, please gather:
    
  1. The <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/how-to-search-court-dockets?_gl=1*1t4lg0v*_ga*Mjc1NTYwNDQxLjE3NDE2MjkwMjA.*_" style="text-decoration: none; color: green; font-weight: bold;">docket number</a> of the eviction case you want to seal
  2. The name of the court that your eviction case was heard in
  3. Information about the reason for your eviction
  4. The date of the **final decision** (judgment) in your eviction case
  5. Eviction cases you have had since the case you are trying to seal, including the original court and any court to which it was transferred

  Some of the information you need can be found in the forms below. You can also find some of this information on [MassCourts.org](https://masscourts.org):up-right-from-square:(opens in new tab).

  * The notice to quit you got from your landlord
  * The summons and complaint
  * The final document from the court that says that a judgment entered against you or the landlord

  <b>NOTE:</b> When you are finished, you will need to file this petition with the Court, either by eFile using a valid email address or in person with the Clerk's office.

  Most people take about 10 minutes to complete this interview.

question: |
  Why did your landlord ask the court to evict you?
subquestion: |
  To answer this question, look at the paperwork that you got from your landlord.

  ${ collapse_template(eviction_reason_template) }

  The landlord told the court in the summons and complaint that:
fields:
  - "Nonpayment of rent: I owed money for rent ": eviction_reason_nonpayment
    datatype: yesnowide
  - "Fault: I broke the lease other than owing rent. For example: a noise complaint or damage to the apartment, or repeatedly paying the rent late.": eviction_reason_fault

    datatype: yesnowide
---
template: eviction_reason_template
subject: |
  How do I know what eviction reason to write?
content: |
  Look at the paperwork that you got from your landlord and from the court. Look for the key words:

  * "Nonpayment of rent"
  * "Breach of lease"
  * "No fault" or "without the fault of the tenant"
  * "139 § 19" or "nuisance" 

  It may list one reason, or more than one reason.

  Even if you were evicted for a "fault" reason, your landlord may have also listed a "nonpayment" reason.
  Make sure to also check the box for "fault" if the landlord said in the court paperwork that you broke another part of the lease.

    datatype: yesno

  - note: |
      You may want to file a motion to deem the judgment satisfied.

      If you have paid all the money you owed, but the court has not deemed the judgment 
      satisfied, you may want to file a motion to deem the judgment satisfied.

      If you are able to, you may also want to ask your landlord to file a notice of 
      satisfaction of judgment with the court.

      Most tenants should **stop** the interview now and come back after the judgment
      is officially satisfied in the court's records.
